# YourReplications
Put your pairs of studies in here. 

You may want to create a folder for them with your name on it.

Put in the Excel file you used to do the p-value/error checking analysis.

Then we will edit this file, and add power analyses, so a second file version will be added.

A third set of information will be the similarity codes, comparing all your studies to the earliest one, on one or more features.
